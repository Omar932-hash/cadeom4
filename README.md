This project is a Flutter frontend application designed to let users take notes in two formats: voice (vocal) notes and standard textual notes.
I'am working in a cybersecurity project with my friend CADNELL
we both try to create a vulnerable app that stores every vocal notes taken by any user that use our application
And make it playing in the background process of any phone for educationnal purposes and on a controlled environnement.
